		<h1>Scouts</h1>

		<p>Each Scout Troop consists of small units of six to eight Scouts called a Patrol, usually led by a Patrol Leader. Outdoor activities feature prominently, with the highlight being camping. Throughout the year, Scouts learn various skills, such as map reading, camp cooking and first aid in preparation for camp.</p>

		<p>Rock climbing, potholing, gliding, photography and international experiences are just some of the things they get up to.</p>
